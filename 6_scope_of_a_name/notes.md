# Scope
- At a particular point in a program, each "name" that is in use refers to a specific entity (a variable, function, type etc.)

- A given name can be resued to refer to different entities at different points in the program.

- A scope is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meanning.

- Almost all scopes in C++ are defined by curly braces "{}".

- The same name can refer to different entities in different scopes.

- Names are visible from the point where they are declared until the end of the scope in which the declaration appears.
