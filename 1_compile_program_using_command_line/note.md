# Compiling and executing C++ programs
## Compiling and executing a very simple C++ program
In this tutorial, we going to compile a C++ program that print "Hello Thai" to the screen. The source file's name is "hello.cpp" and the ouput file's name is "hello_thai". In oder to do so, we follow the steps below:
1. Open "Terminal"
2. Navigate to the location where the source file is located
3. Compile the program using the following commands:
   - `g++ hello.cpp` $\rightarrow$ oupt the output file with name "a"
   - `g++ hello.cpp -o hello_thai` $\rightarrow$ oupt the output file with name "hello_thai"
4. Run the output file
   - Just type `hello_thai.exe` in the terminal (windows style)
