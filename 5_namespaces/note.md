# What is a namespace?
A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers inside it.
- Identifiers are the names of types, functions, variables, etc.

Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name colisions that can occur especially when the code base includes multiple libraries.
